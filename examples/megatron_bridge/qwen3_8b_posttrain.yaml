# Primus Post-Training Configuration for Megatron-Bridge
# Example: Qwen3 8B Fine-tuning

# Post-training specific configuration
post_train:
  # Backend framework (currently only 'megatron-bridge' is supported)
  backend: megatron-bridge

  # Path to the recipe/finetune script relative to Megatron-Bridge root
  # Example: examples/recipes/qwen/finetune_qwen3_next_80b_a3b.py
  recipe_script: /workspace/Primus/third_party/megatron-bridge/examples/recipes/qwen3/finetune_qwen3_8b.py

  # Path to pretrained checkpoint (Megatron format)
  pretrained_checkpoint: /workspace/post_training/qwen3-8b_megatron #/path/to/megatron_ckpt

  # Path to backend-specific config file relative to Megatron-Bridge root
  # Example: conf/qwen3_next_80b_a3b_pretrain_override_example.yaml
  config_file: /workspace/Primus/third_party/megatron-bridge/examples/recipes/qwen3/conf/qwen3_8b_finetune.yaml

  # Number of processes per node (default: 8)
  nproc_per_node: 8

# Optional: You can still include other Primus configs here for compatibility
# but they won't be used during post_train execution
